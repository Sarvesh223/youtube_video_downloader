Title: Youtube Video Downloader Using Flask, Pytube
You need to make a downloads folder in order to download the files from youtube. Its a basic flask app to download the files from youtube. I want to create this as chrome extension but in order to make extension I need  to learn more about json and background processing of data.
For now, I'm pushing only these files.
